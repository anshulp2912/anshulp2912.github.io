      - description: This is a continuation of the work done as Machine Learning Internship
          at Knowarth Technologies. Working on improving the classification pipeline
          using a feedback loop using Active Learning concepts. Building a Product
          guide for the released features to ease of use using Wordpress.
        title: Cloudoffis - Associate Engineer [May 2020 - Present]
      - description: Joined the python team to bring the POI done in earlier internship
          to real-life product. Product aimed at automating the SMSF process for Australian
          accountants. Roles involved building Machine Learning models for Document
          Classification(Stacking Models) and setup project architecture. Achieved
          ~99.99% accuracy on Classification task for 10 document wraps and building
          an AWS SQS based distributed system.
        title: Knowarth Technologies - Machine Learning Intern [Jan 2020 - May 2020]
      - description: Project involved developing an API with Flask-Restplus as a Proof
          of Idea. It firstly recognizes the document type using keyword matching
          and machine learning algorithm. It then extracts the critical information,
          finally delivering it to the user in a summarized manner within either a
          JSON or an Excel file format.

      data:
      - description: The project involves creating a system modeled for audio sample
          mainly conversations. The system has to identify various characteristics/features
          such as the number of speakers, who spoke which statement, who spoke at
          what time and the distance of speaker from the recording device.
        title: Speaker Diarization
      - description: In this project, we introduced a new dataset of 307 folk songs
          from five different states of India. From these audio files, we extracted
          different features and tried to classify these songs into their original
          labels. Mel- Spectrograms, when given to a pre-trained ResNet-50 Model,
          produced better results than other features used in our experiment. Finally,
          the paper was accepted to FRMS'20 Conference.
        title: Indian Folk-Song Classification
      - description: The project aimed at developing the old arcade Snake Game using
          the Genetic Algorithm that allows the computer to make moves for the snake
          which were learnt over the generations by running the algorithm several
          times. Results show that computer scored a lot more points than an average
          human being.
        title: Slytherin Game using Genetic Algorithm
      - description: The project involves developing an android app that displays
          all the songs stored in the local storage that can be played using a minimalistic
          user interface. The interface allows users to like the songs they hear and
          those songs are then saved onto an online database. These liked songs were
          then compared with other users who liked similar songs to provide new recommendations
          using Machine Learning algorithm.

      - description: The project was a research-oriented work that involved extracting
          cepstral features from audio obtained from the ASVSpoof 2017 benchmark dataset,
          which were then analyzed to find out which features better affect the decision
          of whether the spoken speech is genuine or spoof.
        title: Playback Attack Detection for Speaker Verification Systems
      - description: The project involves developing a N-gram probabilistic model
          that predicts the next possible words based on the entered word or a sentence
          by the user. The prediction made by a pre-trained model trained on the text
          of multiple storybooks.
        title: Next-Word Prediction
      - description: The project utilizes a combination of python and natural language
          processing to create a custom model that helps machine classify text based
          on person, location, money, time, date and much more. We show the use of
          Bidirectional LSTM and BERT Models to overcome the problem. The project
          can be launched as demo version using Gradio.
